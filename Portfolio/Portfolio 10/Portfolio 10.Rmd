### This document is Xuanyu's 10th (last) portfolio for Mason's R course. This portfolio demontrates how to do EFA analysis in R and how to understand the differences between R and SPSS. Specifically, it's my first time realizing that even using the same principle of model fitting, the mathatical formula behind them can be quite different. Here, when all using priciple axis analysis with promax rotation, the results from R package and SPSS can be slightly different from each other. 


```{r, warning=FALSE}

## #1
library(haven)
df1 <- read_sav("df1.sav")

library(psych)
library(GPArotation)


nofactors = fa.parallel(df1, fm="pa", fa="fa")

round1 = fa(df1, nfactors=3, rotate = "promax", fm = "pa")
round1
summary(round1)


## #2
model1 <- lm(q1 ~ q2 + q3  + q4 +q5 + q6 +q7 + q8 +q9, data = df1)
summary(model1)

model2 <- lm(q2 ~ q1 + q3  + q4 +q5 + q6 +q7 + q8 +q9, data = df1)
summary(model2)

round2 = fa(df1, nfactors=2, rotate = "promax", fm = "pa")
round2

round3 = fa(df1, nfactors=2, rotate = "none", fm = "pa")
round3


## #3
df2 <- read_sav("df2.sav")[,-1]


#df2[,c(2,6,8,9,12,18,21,23,24,27,31,34,35,37,41,43)] <- 6 - df2[,c(2,6,8,9,12,18,21,23,24,27,31,34,35,37,41,43)]

nofactors = fa.parallel(df2, fm="pa", fa="fa")

mf1 <- fa(df2, nfactors = 5, rotate ="promax", fm = "pa" )
mf1
loadings(mf1, sort=TRUE)

print(loadings(mf1), digits=2, cutoff=.2, sort=TRUE)

mf2 <- fa(df2, nfactors = 3, rotate ="promax", fm = "pa" )
mf2
loadings(mf2, sort=TRUE)

print(loadings(mf2), digits=2, cutoff=.2, sort=TRUE)

```
