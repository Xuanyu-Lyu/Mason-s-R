### This document is Xuanyu's 6th portfolio for Mason's R course. This portfolio demontrates a combination of simulation twin data from "discord" package (and the kinsim() function) and to build an ace model with the OpenMx. I wrote some functions and scripts to smooth the process so we can fit thousands of models with ambigeous twins (r = .51 to 1) vs DZ twins (r = .5). And finnaly put the relatedness, total variance and three ACE variance components into summary dataframes in a overall list. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# I suggest not run the simulation unless you tweak the amounts of output.

source("Simulation.R")

```
